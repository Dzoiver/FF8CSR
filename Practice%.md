### Mod has 3 routes:
- Practice% (~1.5h long) for practicing menus and testing any different routes.  
Battles are also included in order to get AP.  
Autosplitter works with almost all splits except for Corridor, Leaving horizon, Air soldier. Remove it from splits.
- Practice% with stepcount.
Not tested much. Autosplitter will skip some splits.
- Stepcount% includes only stepcount screens.
Use F4 to get the AP for Diablos to get Enc-half/none.  
No idea how autosplitter will work with this but probably a lot of splits will be skipped.
